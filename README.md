# Student Profile Evaluator

## Overview
The Student Profile Evaluator is an advanced system designed to predict student academic performance and provide comprehensive profile evaluations for career planning and higher education opportunities. This project aims to assist both students and faculty in making data-driven decisions to improve academic outcomes and career prospects.

## Features
- CGPA Prediction: Accurately predicts final Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on early academic performance.
- Profile Evaluation: Assesses student profiles considering various factors such as academic performance, standardized test scores, internships, and extracurricular activities.
- Personalized Recommendations: Suggests suitable programs, courses, and universities based on individual student profiles.
- Data Visualization: Utilizes Tableau for insightful data analysis and visualization.
- Machine Learning Integration: Implements various ML algorithms using Microsoft Azure ML Studio for accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel: Data management and initial processing
- Tableau: Data visualization and analysis
- Microsoft Azure ML Studio: Machine learning model implementation
- Python: Data preprocessing and analysis
